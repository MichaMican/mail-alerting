# What you'll need
- ESP32
- Reed switch
- Resistor (300 Ohm - other resistances should work too though)
- Raspberry Pi (Zero)
- Mqtt Broker (can also be installed on the Raspberry Pi)

# How to Setup

1. Replace the code as necessary and described below
2. Wire up the ESP
3. Upload MailAlertingClient.ino to ESP
4. Setup RapberryPi
5. _OPTIONAL: Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker on RasberryPi)_
6. Copy receiverService.py to /home/pi/ directory
7. Install pip dependencies
8. Copy MailboxReceiverService.service to /etc/systemd/system/
9. Make script executable (chmod)
10. Set neccesary enviroment variables 
11. Reload systemd & enable service

## Code
1. Clone the repo
2. Replace variable values:

## ESP Setup
### Dependencies
- https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
- https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient
- Optional: If using a third party ESP board you might have to install drivers for the board manually

### Wiring
1. Connect a reed switch to the 3V3 PIN and the G13 (GPIO 13) pin.
2. Connect the G13 switch with the resistor to any GND (ground) pin.

## Raspberry Pi Setup
### Dependencies
- https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up
- python 3 (Usualy included with the OS)
- https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/
- https://pypi.org/project/pushnotifier/
- Optional: If you want to host the MQTT broker on the Raspberry Pi https://mosquitto.org/download/

### Raspberry Pi Setup
Install Python dependencies
```console
> pip install paho-mqtt
> pip install pushnotifier
```
Setup systemd to automatically start the receiverService.py
```console
> sudo chmod 744 MailboxReceiverService.service
> sudo chmod +x MailboxReceiverService.service
> sudo systemctl daemon-reload
> sudo systemctl enable MailboxReceiverService.service
> sudo systemctl start MailboxReceiverService.service
```
> NOTE: To Debug the systemd setup you can use `sudo systemctl status MailboxReceiverService.service` for the general status and `journalctl -e -u MailboxReceiverService` for more detailed logs


## Setting environment variables 
This was introduced as a security practice to keep credentials out of script files.

### Temporary Environment Variables

You can set an environment variable temporarily for your current terminal session using the `export` command:

```bash
export PUSH_NOTIFIER_USERNAME="your_username"
export PUSH_NOTIFIER_PASSWORD="your_password"
export PUSH_NOTIFIER_APIKEY="your_api_key"
```
### Permanent Environment Variables for user
To set environment variables for a user permanently, you can add the export commands to the user's profile file. For a typical user, you can add them to the ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file

```bash
echo 'export PUSH_NOTIFIER_USERNAME="your_username"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PUSH_NOTIFIER_PASSWORD="your_password"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PUSH_NOTIFIER_APIKEY="your_api_key"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
